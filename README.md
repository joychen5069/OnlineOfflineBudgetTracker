## Description
  
This application will assist you in keeping track of your expenses when you have internet and when you don't! The offline feature is extremely helpful for when users are in areas where the internet is sparse or super expensive and just not worth connecting to. This budget application will store your transactions offline until you get an opportunity to connect to the internet. None of the your transactions will be lost again! This progressive web application utilizes JavaScript, Express, and MongoDB to provide a friendly budget app.
